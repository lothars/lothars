- 👋 Hi, I’m @lothars
- 👀 I’m interested in fast databases + (J)CL/cobol, c#.net and python back-ends on z(/i)-series, win and linux (virtual) machines.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning restfull api's with python3, django and django restfull framework + deployment in containers
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever has my focus for the moment .
- 📫 How to reach me ... Well if you're reading this you must have found me =D
- How to stay on my good side? If it isn't mission critical, ask someone else ;-)
- A free advice : If it isn't mission critical, don't bother. Make you mission critical things better in stead.
